# Deadly new drugs found in fake medicines in the UK

In October, we worked with BBC News's Midlands & South Bureau to [report](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2520kvl1wo) super-strength drugs linked to hundreds of deaths had been found in samples of fake medicines bought across the UK.

We had found more than 100 examples of people trying to buy prescription medicines such as diazepam - commonly used to treat anxiety, muscle spasms and seizures - and instead receiving products containing nitazenes.

At that time, the synthetic opioid drugs had been connected to 278 deaths across the country in a year, according to the National Crime Agency (NCA). Nitazenes could be stronger than both heroin and fentanyl, a prolific killer in the US.

Martin Raithelhuber, an illicit synthetic drug expert from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, said the BBC’s findings were a “very worrying development”.

A government spokesperson said it was “securing our borders from the threat” through “world-leading intelligence, dedicated cross-government taskforce and extensive international networks”.

The contaminated substances were identified in anonymous samples submitted to WEDINOS, the only national drug-checking service in the UK.

It said the fake medicines looked like "the same kind of packet you might get from your chemist on the high street" but were "most likely purchased from illicit online pharmacies".

# Methodology

We analysed published sample results, which had been submitted anonymously to the UK’s only national drug testing service WEDINOS, run by Public Health Wales. The service recorded what the person submitting the substance said they had intended to buy and their “purchase intent”.

The analysis revealed 130 instances between August 2023 and September 2024 where people tried to buy medicines that were available by prescription, which were shown to have been contaminated with nitazenes. A further 34 samples in the same time period, were confirmed to be heroin contaminated with nitazenes.

Many of the contaminated substances were purporting to be benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, and insomnia treatments including temazepam and zolpidem. There were also examples of nitazenes found in substances sold as promethazine, an allergy medication.

Diazepam is also sometimes used non-medically. The substances were predominantly submitted to WEDINOS as tablets, but were also submitted in other forms.

NB: As the service said itself, WEDINOS data were not a definitive and exhaustive way of finding out the prevalence of synthetic opioids because the samples were sent in voluntarily, but they revealed some of the patterns and trends emerging, including in this instance, that nitazenes were being found in so-called fake medicines. 


# What were nitazenes?

- Nitazenes were first developed in the 1950s as a pain-killing medication but were so potent and addictive they had never been approved for medical or therapeutic use
- Injected, inhaled or swallowed, mixing them with other drugs and alcohol was extremely dangerous and significantly increased the risk of overdose and death
- The UK Government planned to make all types of nitazenes Class A drugs with new legislation. Fifteen named synthetic opioids were reclassified in March 2024.

# The UK data we provided:

- Our analysis of the results of drug samples submitted anonymously to, then tested by, the UK’s only national drug testing service, WEDINOS - run by Public Health Wales, from 17 August 2023 to 17 September 2024
- Details of the 169 drug samples found by WEDINOS to contain synthetic opioids from 17 August 2023 to 17 September 2024
- A breakdown by UK region of the numbers of drug samples found by WEDINOS to contain synthetic opioids from 17 August 2023 to 17 September 2024, and whether the synthetic opioids were found contaminating so-called “fake medicines”, heroin, or other substances
- Information on the contaminated substances - the “fake medicines” - to assist reporting including: names of drugs which were contaminated with synthetic opioids; the intended use of the genuine pharmaceuticals and the source of that information eg NHS website. There was also a guide as to whether each drug was a brand name or trademark to assist reporting
- The most recent figures recording the numbers of deaths across the UK confirmed as involving nitazenes by region, according to the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (OHID) and National Crime Agency (NCA)
- A list of the known variations of these highly-potent new drugs, and an estimation of how strong some variants were in comparison to heroin - eg N-Pyrrolidino-etonitazene was thought to be 500 times stronger than heroin.
