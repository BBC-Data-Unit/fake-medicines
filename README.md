In October, we worked with BBC News's Midlands & South Bureau to [report](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2520kvl1wo) super-strength drugs linked to hundreds of deaths had been found in samples of fake medicines bought across the UK.

We had found more than 100 examples of people trying to buy prescription medicines such as diazepam - commonly used to treat anxiety, muscle spasms and seizures - and instead receiving products containing nitazenes.

At that time, the synthetic opioid drugs had been connected to 278 deaths across the country in a year, according to the National Crime Agency (NCA). Nitazenes can be stronger than both heroin and fentanyl, a prolific killer in the US.

Martin Raithelhuber, an illicit synthetic drug expert from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, said the BBC’s findings were a “very worrying development”.

A government spokesperson said it was “securing our borders from the threat” through “world-leading intelligence, dedicated cross-government taskforce and extensive international networks”.

The contaminated substances were identified in anonymous samples submitted to WEDINOS, the only national drug-checking service in the UK.

It said the fake medicines looked like "the same kind of packet you might get from your chemist on the high street" but were "most likely purchased from illicit online pharmacies".
